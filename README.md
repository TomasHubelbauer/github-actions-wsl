# GitHub Actions WSL

GitHub Actions Windows images have WSL.

## To-Do

### Study actions/setup-wsl to see how it could be useful to me

https://github.com/marketplace/actions/setup-wsl

### Fix the issue with the kernel - see if WSL2 is needed or WSL1 will work too

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual#step-4---download-the-linux-kernel-update-package

This will fix WSL2 I guess but I wonder if WSL1 can be made to work, too.

I would like to find the most minimal scripts needed to get WSL1 and WSL2 print
`whoami`.
