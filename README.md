# GitHub Actions WSL

Is there WSL on the Windows-based GitHub Actions agents?

## To-Do

### Await reply on the `-NoRestart` request

Neither `wsl` nor `ubuntu` work after having enabled WSL.
`bash` works but it is a Windows version (see `bash --version`).
It is there even before enabling WSL.
